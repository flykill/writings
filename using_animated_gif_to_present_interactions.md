At my work, I often need to share a design with remote teams. The best we can do is to share computer screen via online conferencing applications such as WebEx. After a review meeting, usually there'll be a few design iterations. But I cannot call for a meeting for every iteration because remote design reviews like this — and remote meetings in general — have high time cost. So I'd document and email the changes to all stakeholders together with a link to the interactive prototype (note if you don't have an interactive prototype, this could be way harder). Describing interactions in words, however, is very hard. These emails can get very long. When emails get long, nobody reads them. Some ignore them. Some just open the prototype and play with it for a minute. Most people don't notice the changes at all. It's not that they are ignorant. When you have the entire prototype in front of you, it's very hard to pay attention to the new features if nobody tells you where to look at.

I tried to use screencasts — a recorded video of me showing the prototype and talking. This is pretty heavy-weight and costs time to produce. I also need a place to host the videos because they're too big to send by email.

Then I came across a [blog post](http://line25.com/articles/creative-uses-animated-gifs-present-ui-designs) showing creative usage of animated GIFs to present UI designs. While these animations are too cool and fancy for me, I realize this could be a viable approach to present interactions.

Below is an example.

This is an simple interaction: by clicking a button, the user adds the product into her shopping cart and a new recommendation comes in. It seems simple when you see it in action. It is extremely hard to describe this interaction in words.

Of course, animated GIFs won't be suitable for presenting all kinds of ideas. But I do think it hits the sweet spot when the interaction is focused and small in scope.

Mailchimp [used GIFs](http://blog.mailchimp.com/showing-vs-telling-with-gifs/) in their emails to announce new UI features. The notion of showing how something works to people is very powerful. As they said it:

> We’ve all tried to explain something to someone using words, only to find ourselves saying, "Here, let me just show you."

So, next time you want to share a piece of interaction, try animated GIFs.
